NetLogo correctly supports order of operations for infix operators. The operators work as follows: + is addition, * is multiplication, - is subtraction, / is division, ^ is exponentiation, < is less than, > is greater than, = is equal to, != is not equal to, <= is less than or equal, >= is greater than or equal. Note that the subtraction operator (-) always takes two inputs unless you put parentheses around it, in which case it can take one input. For example, to take the negative of x, write (- x), with the parentheses. All of the comparison operators also work on strings. All of the comparison operators work on agents. Turtles are compared by who number. Patches are compared top to bottom left to right, so patch 0 10 is less than patch 0 9 and patch 9 0 is less than patch 10 0. Links are ordered by end points and in case of a tie by breed. So link 0 9 is before link 1 10 as the end1 is smaller, and link 0 8 is less than link 0 9. If there are multiple breeds of links unbreeded links will come before breeded links of the same end points and breeded links will be sorted in the order they are declared in the Code tab. Agentsets can be tested for equality or inequality. Two agentsets are equal if they are the same type (turtle or patch or link) and contain the same agents. If you are not sure how NetLogo will interpret your code, you should add parentheses. show 5 * 6 + 6 / 3 => 32 show 5 * (6 + 6) / 3 => 20 Many extension objects may be tested for equality and inequality using = and !=. For instance, the array, matrix, and table objects returned by their respective extensions may be compared for equality / inequality. Extension objects may not be tested using <, >, <=, or >=."

Turtles that are connected by links in link-set but not included in turtle-set are treated as anchors and are not moved. spring-constant is a measure of the \"tautness\" of the spring. It is the \"resistance\" to change in their length. spring-constant is the force the spring would exert if it's length were changed by 1 unit. spring-length is the \"zero-force\" length or the natural length of the springs. This is the length which all springs try to achieve either by pushing out their nodes or pulling them in. repulsion-constant is a measure of repulsion between the nodes. It is the force that 2 nodes at a distance of 1 unit will exert on each other. The repulsion effect tries to get the nodes as far as possible from each other, in order to avoid crowding and the spring effect tries to keep them at \"about\" a certain distance from the nodes they are connected to. The result is the laying out of the whole network in a way which highlights relationships among the nodes and at the same time is crowded less and is visually pleasing.

The turtles in turtle-set are then laid out in the following manner: Each turtle is placed at centroid (or barycenter) of the polygon formed by its linked neighbors. (The centroid is like a 2-dimensional average of the coordinates of the neighbors.) (The purpose of the circle of \"anchor agents\" is to prevent all the turtles from collapsing down to one point.) After a few iterations of this, the layout will stabilize.

Note that you can't use run to define or redefine procedures. If you care about performance, note that the code must be compiled first which takes time. However, compiled bits of code are cached by NetLogo and thus using run on the same string over and over is much faster than running different strings. The first run, though, will be many times slower than running the same code directly, or in an anonymous command. Anonymous procedures are recommended over strings whenever possible. (An example of when you must use strings is if you accept pieces of code from the user of your model.) Anonymous procedures may freely read and/or set local variables and procedure inputs. Trying to do the same with strings may or may not work and should not be relied on. When using anonymous procedures, you can provide them with inputs, if you surround the entire call with parentheses.

It holds the turtle's \"who number\" or ID number, an integer greater than or equal to zero. You cannot set this variable; a turtle's who number never changes. Who numbers start at 0. A dead turtle's number will not be reassigned to a new turtle until you use the clear-turtles or clear-all commands, at which time who numbering starts over again at 0. Example: show [who] of turtles with [color = red] ;; prints a list of the who numbers of all red turtles ;; in the Command Center, in random order crt 100 [ ifelse who < 50 [ set color red ] [ set color blue ] ] ;; turtles 0 through 49 are red, turtles 50 ;; through 99 are blue You can use the turtle reporter to retrieve a turtle with a given who number. See also turtle. Note that who numbers aren't breed-specific. No two turtles can have the same who number, even if they are different breeds: clear-turtles create-frogs 1 create-mice 1 ask turtles [ print who ] ;; prints (in some random order): ;; (frog 0): 0 ;; (mouse 1): 1 Even though we only have one mouse, it is mouse 1 not mouse 0, because the who number 0 was already taken by the frog."

(If you want to run the commands with a fresh random state instead of the same random state that will be restored later, you can begin the commands with random-seed new-seed.) The following example demonstrates that the random number generator state is the same both before the commands run and afterwards. random-seed 10 with-local-randomness [ print n-values 10 [random 10] ] ;; prints [8 9 8 4 2 4 5 4 7 9] print n-values 10 [random 10] ;; prints [8 9 8 4 2 4 5 4 7 9]"
