Here's an overview of the pmn-marrow-function:\n\n1. The function starts by using the `repeat` command with a loop expression `(int (1 + total-GCSF / 100))`, which indicates that the number of neutrophils to be produced is determined by the value of the total-GCSF (Granulocyte Colony-stimulating factor) variable.\n\n2. Within the loop, an `if` statement is used to randomly generate new PMNs. The probability of producing a new PMN is set to 10%. If the condition is met (random number between 0 and 10 is less than 1), a single PMN is hatched using the `hatch` command, and the newborn PMN is configured with the required properties such as breed, color, wbc-roll, wbc-stick, wbc-migrate, pmn-age, pmn-pcd, and its initial position is set by jumping random 100.\n\n3. The `pmn-marrow-function` continues iterating through the loop (producing more PMNs) until the total number of PMNs required by the current GCSF level has been achieved.\n\nIn summary, the `to pmn-marrow-function` represents the primary role of the PMN marrow in producing PMNs based on the GCSF stimuli, which plays a crucial role in maintaining immune system function and providing a sufficient amount of PMNs to respond to infections and injuries.

The procedure begins with the `rt random 45` command, which makes the turtle turn right by a random angle between 0 and 45 degrees. This random turn adds some unpredictability to the movement pattern of the immune cell or turtle.\n\n2. Next, the procedure includes the `lt random 45` command, which makes the turtle turn left by a random angle between 0 and 45 degrees. This turn counteracts the previous right turn, allowing for a more dynamic and unpredictable movement pattern.\n\n3. Finally, the procedure ends with the `fd 1` command, which makes the turtle move forward by one patch length (the default grid size in NetLogo is typically one patch). This forward motion causes the turtle to explore its environment and interact with other cells and patches.\n\nIn summary, the `to wiggle` procedure adds stochastic movement behavior to turtles, such as immune cells, helping them explore their environment and interact with other turtles and patches during the immune response simulation. The combination of random turns and forward motion results in a more dynamic and unpredictable movement pattern, creating a more realistic and adaptive immune simulation."
