The `mono_sniff` function computes the PAF environment variables in the neighboring patches and adjusts the turtle's heading based on the provided NetLogo code snippet. Note that it calls the `getPatchAhead`, `getPatchRightAndAhead`, and `getPatchLeftAndAhead` helper functions, assuming those are properly implemented to return the requested neighboring `Patch`. Finally, it calls the `move` function to move the turtle, and you should replace the move call with its implementation.",

This is consistent with the previous implementation I provided, so you can use both declarations and implementations together. When implementing functions, always ensure they share the same name, return type (if exists), arguments, and access control (public/private)."
