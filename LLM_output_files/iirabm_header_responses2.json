The breeds are defined using the `breed` keyword at the beginning of the script.\\\\n      2. Each breed is given a name, the first input defines the name of the turtleset associated with the breed, and the second input defines the name of a single member of the breed.\\\\n      3. These breeds serve to group different types of turtles together, allowing for easier manipulation of specific groups, when using `ask` commands.\\\\n\\\\n      None of the provided code snippet initializes or performs operations on any of these variables. It only defines the breeds and their respective names. The code snippet provided is not sufficient to determine the exact actions taken on these variables if any were present.\\\"\\n\": \"To integrate the provided breeds into the existing simulation framework, you'll need to follow a series of steps that involve creating corresponding breed-specific vector of shared pointers for each breed.\\n        ```cpp\\n        // world.h\\n        std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Turtle>> all_turtles; // General turtle vector\\n        std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Turtle>> all_injs;   // Vector for inj breed\\n        std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Turtle>> all_pmns;   // Vector for pmn breed\\n        std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Turtle>> all_bands;  // Vector for bands breed\\n        // ... and so on for other breeds\\n\\n        ```\\n      \\n\\n        2. In the `World` class, create a function to handle the creation, tracking, and return of a single instance of a specific breed. Add these functions for each breed in the `world.h` header file:\\n\\n        ```cpp\\n        // world.h\\n        std::shared_ptr<Turtle> create_inj_turtle(int x, int y);\\n        std::shared_ptr<Turtle> create_pmn_turtle(int x, int y);\\n        std::shared_ptr<Turtle> create_band_turtle(int x, int y);\\n        // ... and so on for other breeds\\n        ```\\n        \\n        3. Implement these functions in the `World` class's source file (`.cpp`) to create, initialize, and add breed-specific instances to the corresponding vectors and patch, similar to the following:\\n        \\n        ```cpp\\n        // world.cpp\\n        std::shared_ptr<Turtle> World::create_inj_turtle(int x, int y) {\\n           std::shared_ptr<Turtle> inj_turtle = std::make_shared<Turtle>(x, y, global_ID_counter++);\\n       std::weak_ptr<Turtle> inj_weak_ptr = pmn_turtle   // creating a weak pointer to give to all turtles vector\\n           all_turtles.push_back(inj_weak_ptr);\\n           all_injs.push_back(inj_turtle);\\n        \\n           Patch& patch = get_patch(x, y);\\n           patch.add_turtle(inj_turtle);\\n        \\n           return inj_turtle;\\n        }\\n        \\n        std::shared_ptr<Turtle> World::create_pmn_turtle(int x, int y) {\\n           std::shared_ptr<Turtle> pmn_turtle = std::make_shared<Turtle>(x, y, global_ID_counter++);\\n            std::weak_ptr<Turtle> pmn_weak_ptr = pmn_turtle   // creating a weak pointer to give to all turtles vector\\n        \\n           all_turtles.push_back(pmn_weak_ptr);\\n           all_pmns.push_back(pmn_turtle);\\n        \\n           Patch& patch = get_patch(x, y);\\n           patch.add_turtle(pmn_turtle);\\n        \\n           return pmn_turtle;\\n        }\\n        \\n        // ... and so on for other breeds\\n\\n        ```\\n        \\n\",\n": "\"\\\"To create a new turtle of a specific breed (e.g., inj, pmn, bands) in the simulation, you need to use the create\\_ function associated with that breed (create\\_inj\\_turtle, create\\_pmn\\_turtle, or create\\_bands\\_turtle), and pass the desired x and y coordinates as arguments. The function returns a shared\\_ptr to the newly created turtle. This shared\\_ptr can then be used to interact with the turtle or to store it in a data structure, such as a vector.\\n\\\n\nFor instance, consider creating a new PMN turtle at position (2, 3):\\n\n\n```cpp\\n\nstd::shared_ptr<Turtle> new_pmn = world->create_pmn_turtle(2, 3);\\n\n```\\n\n\nThe returned shared\\_ptr, `new_pmn`, can be used to access the PMN turtle, update its properties, execute its behaviors, or add it to another data structure.\\n\\\n\nTo create multiple turtles of a specific breed, use a loop to call the create\\_ function with different coordinates:\\n\n\n```cpp\\n\nfor (int x = 0; x < 10; x++) {\\n    for (int y = 0; y < 10; y++) {\\n       std::shared_ptr<Turtle> new_pmn = world->create_pmn_turtle(x, y);\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\\n```\\n\\\n\nIn this example, 100 new PMN turtles are created and placed in random positions within a 10x10 area.\\\"\\n\"\n\nRegarding adding this new turtles to a specific data structure, the provided code snippet does not include any examples. However, below is an example of adding a new turtle to a vector named all\\_my\\_turtles.\n\n```cpp\nworld->all_my_turtles.push_back(new_turtle);\n```\n\nThis example assumes that there is already a vector named 'all\\_my\\_turtles' in the World class. Also, the 'new\\_turtle' is the shared\\_ptr to the newly created turtle."
