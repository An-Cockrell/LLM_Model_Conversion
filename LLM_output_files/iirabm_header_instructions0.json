Make sure to take the `World` class as an argument so the behaviors can properly interact with the simulation environment.\n\nOnce this new breed is implemented, you will be able to create `deer` turtles using the `create_deer_turtle` function and manipulate their behavior and interactions within the An-Cockrell research lab simulation framework.",

Since random positions are generated, you might come across positions that are already occupied, in which case the simulation will generate new random positions until it finds an empty one. This approach ensures that the simulation starts with the required number of deer and wolves without causing overlaps with existing creatures.",

If you need to initialize grass at a different value, simply update the initial value of the grass variable in the constructor accordingly.\n\nThis change to the An-Cockrell research lab simulation framework enables managing grass individually for each patch and allows tracking grass levels during the simulation.",
